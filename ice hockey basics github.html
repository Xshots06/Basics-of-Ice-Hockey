<br> 

   <p>      The goalies primary job is to stop the puck from going into their own net.                             </p>

   <br>
   <br>
   <br>

<h3>       Wingers                           </h3>


<br>


<p>     A team at full strength has two wingers one on the right side of the ice and the other winger on the left side of the ice.

the wingers are supose to stay on the aposing teams defence and also break the buck out of their own zone and into the oposing teams zone by passing and dangling through the other teams
players. the wingers are also supposed to take shots at the other teams net and try to score.

   Their is one defence player on the left half of the ice and the other defense playe is on the right side of the ice. The defences job is to stop the opposing team from breaking 
   out of their zone and into our zone.

<br>



<p>    This position requires a lot of creativity and a very high level of skill. the center be good at face-offs and passing to their teamates. the center also should be a 
    really good skater and have a power full shot.                                      </p>
